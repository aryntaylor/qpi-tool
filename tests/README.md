# QPI - Quick Project Initialiser

## Overview

QPI is a simple and efficient command-line utility designed to greatly speed-up the process of setting up projects.

This tool aims to save you time and effort by automating the initial project setup, so you can focus on what really matters - writing code.

## Features

- **Project Directory Structure**: The tool creates a well-organized project directory structure, ensuring consistency across your projects.

- **Python Support**: Currently, the tool is tailored for general purpose and Python projects.Use ```-py``` or ```--pysetup``` as an optional flag to setup the python files.

- **Extensible**: While Python is currently the only language-specific support, I have plans to expand support for other programming languages in the future.
